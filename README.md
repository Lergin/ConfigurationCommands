# ConfigurationCommands
a sponge plugin for custom commands that can be createt via a configuration file or a command



## Add a Command

You have two ways to add a new command: You can edit the configuration file of the plugin or add a command ingame with the help of the addCommand. 

### ingame (addcmd)
To add a command ingame you need to use the addCommand (/addcmd <name> <command> <message...>).
The first parameter is the name / identifier for the command, that you later need to edit or delete the command.
The second parameter is a command that your users use to use the command, the last parameter is the message that is shown if the command is executed.
